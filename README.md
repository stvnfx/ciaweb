A webpage to notify user's that Cars in action is down

The DNS records was pointing for some time to 178.62.43.44
and that was a Digital Ocean IP for Car's In Action's past
website.

Since that VM was deleted a long time ago it was reassigned to
someone else. 

At the current time of writing this 10 November 2016 that VM IP now belongs 
to either Brown & Corbishley or the web design company Webtise.

Sadly if you googled Brown & Corbishley the first link was carsinaction.net and not
their own and I am sure that must be frustrating :)
